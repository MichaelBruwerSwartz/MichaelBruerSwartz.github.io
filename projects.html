          <p class="project-box-description">This was my first semester computer science project at the university of Stellenbosch. It was based on a card game known as AirRace where the goal is to collect 10 suitcases before your opponent does while keeping a positive balance. Other functionalities where added by the inclusion of <i>obstacle disks</i> such as moving your oppinents airport or gaining balance based on current game conditions. My final score was 100% and I achieved full marks for the "AI" auto solver. Feel free to contact me for more information about the project.</p>
